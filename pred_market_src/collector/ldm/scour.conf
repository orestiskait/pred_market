# LDM Scour Configuration — scour.conf
# =============================================================================
# Scour (cleanup) schedule for LDM data directories.
# Entries prevent disk from filling up.  Scour runs from LDM crontab.
#
# Format:
#   <directory>  <retention-days>  [pattern]
#
# The ldm_surface parquet files are small (<1MB/day per station),
# but raw products can accumulate if the debug FILE action is enabled.
# =============================================================================

# Raw debug WMO products (only if FILE action in pqact.conf is uncommented)
/home/ldm/var/data/ldm_raw       3

# Parquet observations are permanent (they're our trading data),
# so don't scour them.  Instead, rely on external backup/rotation.
# If disk is tight, uncomment the next line to keep only 30 days:
# /home/ldm/var/data/weather_obs   30
