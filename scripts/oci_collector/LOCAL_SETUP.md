## Files Required for the Collector (Not in GitHub)

These files are created locally, copied to the VM, or generated during setup. They are not committed to the repository.

### On the OCI VM (`/home/ubuntu/`)

| Path | Purpose | What it must contain |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `~/.kalshi/kalshi_api_key.txt` | Kalshi API private key | PEM-format private key for Kalshi API authentication. Copy from your local machine before running `setup.sh`. |
| `~/.kalshi/collector.env` | Docker env file | Generated by `setup.sh`. Contains `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` and `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` (base64-encoded PEM). Do not edit manually; re-run setup to change credentials. |
| `~/collector-data/` | Parquet output | Created by `setup.sh`. Mounted into the Docker container. Contains `market_snapshots/`, `orderbook_snapshots/`, `historical/`. |

### On your local machine (for OCI CLI, SSH, fetch_data)

| Path | Purpose | What it must contain |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `~/.oci/config` | OCI CLI configuration | Tenancy OCID, user OCID, region, key fingerprint, path to OCI API private key. Created by `oci setup config`. |
| `~/.oci/<key_file>` | OCI API signing key | PEM private key for OCI API authentication. Referenced in `~/.oci/config`. |
| `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa` | SSH key pair | Used to connect to the VM and by `launch.sh` for cloud-init. Public key is injected at instance launch. |

## Credential flow (no secrets in this doc)

1. **Kalshi API**: You obtain an API key ID and private key PEM from Kalshi. Copy the PEM to `~/.kalshi/kalshi_api_key.txt` on the VM, then run `setup.sh` (which prompts for the key ID and creates `collector.env`).
2. **OCI**: `oci setup config` creates `~/.oci/config` and stores the path to your OCI API key. You need an OCI account and API key from the Console.
3. **SSH**: Your SSH public key is used by `launch.sh`; the private key is used to connect to the VM.
